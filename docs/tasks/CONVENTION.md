# Task Convention

This document defines the format, lifecycle, and multi-agent protocol for tasks stored in `docs/tasks/`.

## Purpose

Tasks are the mechanism for humans to inject work into the project via git and for agents to
discover, claim, and execute that work. The system is designed for:

- **Human authoring**: humans write tasks in markdown, store drafts, and promote to todo when ready.
- **Agent discovery**: agents scan frontmatter only (not full body) to find actionable work.
- **Multi-agent safety**: claiming protocol prevents duplicate work across clones.

## File Format

Each task is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: 1
title: Short imperative title
status: todo
priority: medium
created: 2026-01-01
updated: 2026-01-01
assigned_to: ""
assigned_at: ""
depends_on: []
tags: [area-x]
---

## Objective

What needs to be done and why.

## Requirements

- Requirement 1

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | integer | yes | Unique task ID, matches filename prefix |
| title | string | yes | Short imperative description (< 80 chars) |
| status | enum | yes | Current lifecycle state (see below) |
| priority | enum | no | critical, high, medium, low (default: medium) |
| created | date | yes | ISO 8601 date when task was created |
| updated | date | yes | ISO 8601 date of last status change |
| assigned_to | string | no | Identifier of the agent/human working on it |
| assigned_at | datetime | no | ISO 8601 timestamp when assignment happened |
| depends_on | list[int] | no | IDs of tasks that must complete first |
| tags | list[string] | no | Categorization tags |

### Naming Convention

Files are named `<id>_<SLUG>.md` where:
- `<id>` is a sequential integer
- `<SLUG>` is an uppercase snake_case summary
- Example: `3_ADD_CACHING_LAYER.md`

The special file CONVENTION.md (this file) is not a task.

## Status Lifecycle

```
draft --> todo --> in_progress --> done
                      |
                      +--> blocked --> in_progress
```

| Status | Meaning | Who sets it |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| draft | Work in progress by the author; not ready for agents | Human |
| todo | Ready to be picked up; requirements are complete | Human |
| in_progress | Actively being worked on by an assigned agent | Agent |
| blocked | Cannot proceed; dependency or question unresolved | Agent |
| done | All acceptance criteria met; work is complete | Agent |

Rules:
- **Humans** control draft -> todo transitions. Agents must never start work on draft tasks.
- **Agents** control todo -> in_progress -> done transitions.
- Only tasks with status: todo and empty assigned_to are available for pickup.
- Tasks with unresolved depends_on (dependencies not in done status) should not be started.

## Agent Protocol

### Discovering Tasks

Agents should scan task files by reading only frontmatter (first ~15 lines):

1. List files in docs/tasks/ matching [0-9]*_*.md
2. For each file, read the frontmatter block (between --- markers)
3. Filter for status: todo with empty assigned_to and no unresolved dependencies
4. Select a task based on priority and ID order (lower ID = older = prefer first)

### Claiming a Task

To prevent duplicate work across agents on different clones:

1. **Pull latest**: git pull --rebase before claiming
2. **Check status**: re-read the frontmatter to confirm still todo and unassigned
3. **Update frontmatter**: set status: in_progress, assigned_to, assigned_at, updated
4. **Commit and push**: commit with message `task(<id>): claim task <id> - <title>`
5. **If push fails** (conflict): pull, check if someone else claimed it, pick another task

The assigned_to field should be a descriptive identifier, e.g., claude-<machine-hostname> or agent-<session-id>.

### Working on a Task

1. Read the full task body for requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Do the work in one or more commits (reference the task: task(<id>): <description>)
3. When done, update frontmatter: status: done, updated: <today>
4. Commit the status change: task(<id>): complete task <id> - <title>

### Handling Blocks

If the agent cannot proceed:
1. Set status: blocked with a note in the task body explaining why
2. Commit and push so other agents (or humans) can see the block
3. Move on to the next available task

## Prompt Patterns

Humans can invoke agents with these patterns:

- "read CLAUDE.md and implement the next task" — agent picks the lowest-ID todo task
- "read CLAUDE.md and implement task 5" — agent works on task 5 specifically
- "read CLAUDE.md and implement any task tagged infra" — agent filters by tag

## Creating New Tasks

Humans create tasks by:

1. Choosing the next available ID (one higher than the highest existing)
2. Creating docs/tasks/<id>_<SLUG>.md with frontmatter and body
3. Setting status: draft while iterating on the description
4. Changing to status: todo when ready for agent pickup
5. Committing and pushing

## Agent-Created Draft Tasks

Agents may create draft tasks to signal gaps they've discovered during work. These are NOT for decomposing work or asking permission — they are for flagging platform limitations.

**When agents should create a draft task:**
- A verification capability is missing (e.g., "contract runner doesn't support variable capture, can't test auth flows")
- A tool or MCP is needed but unavailable (e.g., "need browser MCP for visual testing")
- A harness limitation blocks the workflow

**Tag conventions for agent-created drafts:**
- `kind:gap` — verification or harness capability gap
- `kind:capability` — missing tool, MCP, or external access

**Format**: Same as human-created tasks, but always set status: draft. The human reviews and promotes to todo if the gap is worth addressing. Agents must never promote their own draft tasks.
